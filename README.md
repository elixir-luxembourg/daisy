# Elixir Daisy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/elixir-luxembourg/daisy.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/elixir-luxembourg/daisy)

Data Information System (DAISY) is a data bookkeeping application designed to help Biomedical Research  institutions with their GDPR compliance.

## Using Docker

### Requirements

* docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/

### Installation

1. Get the source code
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:elixir-luxembourg/daisy.git
    cd daisy
    ```
 1. Create your settings file
    ```bash
    cp elixir_daisy/settings_local.template.py elixir_daisy/settings_local.py
    ```
    Optional: edit the file elixir_daisy/settings_local.py to adapt to your environment.
1. Build daisy docker image  
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    Wait for the build to finish and keep the process running
1. Open a new shell and go to daisy folder

1. Build the database
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    ```
1. Build the solr schema

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py build_solr_schema -c /solr/daisy/conf -r daisy -u default
    ```

1. Compile and deploy static files
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic
    ```
1. Create initial data in the database
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py load_initial_data
    ```
   Initial data includes, for instance, controlled vocabularies terms and initial list of institutions and cohorts.  
   **This step can take several minutes to complete**
    
1. Load demo data
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py load_demo_data
    ```
    This will create mock datasets, projects and create an demo admin account.

1. Optional - import users from an active directory instance

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py import_users
    ```
    
1.  Build the search index
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py rebuild_index -u default
    ```

1. Browse to https://localhost  
    a demo admin account is available:
    ```
        username: admin
        password: demo
    ```

### Operation manual


#### Import projects

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py import_projects -f ${PROJECTS_JSON}
```
where ${PROJECTS_JSON} is the path to a json file containing the projects definitions.  
See file daisy/data/projects.json as an example.
 
#### Import datasets 

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py import_datasets -d ${DATASETS_FOLDER}
```
where ${DATASETS_FOLDER} is the path to a folder containing datasets and data declarations definitions.  
See folder daisy/data/datasets as an example.

## Without Docker - CentOS


See [DEPLOYMENT](DEPLOYMENT.md).


## Development

To be completed.

### Import users from active directory
```bash
./manage.py import_users
```

### Import projects from external system
```bash
./manage.py import_projects -f path/to/json_file.json
```

### Import datasets from external system
```bash
./manage.py import_datasets -d path/to/folder_with_json
```

### Install js and css dependencies

```bash
cd web/static/vendor/
npm install
```

### Compile daisy.scss
```bash
cd web/static/vendor
npm run-script build
```

### Run the built-in web server (for development)

```bash
./manage.py runserver
```

### Run the tests

The following command will install the test dependencies and execute the tests:

```bash
python setup.py pytest
```

If tests dependencies are already installed, one can also run the tests just by executing:

```bash
pytest
```

## Administration

To get access to the admin page, you must log in with a superuser account.  
On the `Users` section, you can give any user a `staff` status and he will be able to access any project/datasets.
